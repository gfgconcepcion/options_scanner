## Deliverables and Aspired Results

_Note: These are subject to change over time._

### Deliverable and Aspired Result 1
A set of profitable approaches in buying, holding, and selling US equity call and put option contracts.

To achieve success, the profitability of these approaches should be at least twice as profitable as the profitability of a buy-and-hold approach of:
1. any S&P 500 index ETF
2. any Nasdaq index ETF
3. any Bitcoin ETF or spot Bitcoin, take the higher profitability value
4. any Ethereum ETF or spot Ethereum, take the higher profitability value

### Deliverable and Aspired Result 2
A working program which resolves a common pain point.

To achieve success, the program should log the following product usage metrics:
1. 2 or more GitHub repository watchers
2. 2 or more GitHub repository stars
3. 2 or more GitHub repository forks

_Note: The relationship between Goal 2 and Deliverable and Aspired Result needs improvement. The relationship is not immediately clear._

### Deliverable and Aspired Result 3
A visited repository.

To achieve success, the repository should log:
1. log at least 1 unique visitor between T1 (time of application submission) and T2 (time of application outcome)
2. be asked about during a discussion between employer and/or customer
