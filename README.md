A special note to friends: _Dear friend, if you read this, please do share your feedback with me!_

## Goal

### Goal 1
The primary goal of this repository is to implement a programmatic approach to  discover( hopefully lucrative) opportunities in US equity call and put option contracts.

### Goals 2 and of lesser priority
The second goal of this repository is to serve as practice using AI-powered coding assistants.

The third goal of this repository is to make visible some of my programming work to prospective employers or customers.

## Deliverables and Aspired Results

_Note: These are subject to change over time._

### Deliverable and Aspired Result 1
A set of profitable approaches in buying, holding, and selling US equity call and put option contracts.

To achieve success, the profitability of these approaches should be at least twice as profitable as the profitability of all of the following buy-and-hold approaches:
1. any S&P 500 index ETF
2. any Nasdaq index ETF
3. any Bitcoin ETF or spot Bitcoin, take the higher profitability value
4. any Ethereum ETF or spot Ethereum, take the higher profitability value

### Deliverable and Aspired Result 2
A working program which resolves a common pain point.

To achieve success, the program should log all of the following product usage metrics:
1. 2 or more GitHub repository watchers
2. 2 or more GitHub repository stars
3. 2 or more GitHub repository forks

_Note: The relationship between Goal 2 and Deliverable and Aspired Result needs improvement. The relationship is not immediately clear. In addition, depending on how this program UI is implemented, other logging measurements and as a result other product usage metrics may be more effective._

### Deliverable and Aspired Result 3
A visited repository.

To achieve success, the repository should:
1. log 1 or more unique visitors between T1 (time of application submission) and T2 (time of application outcome)
2. be asked about more about during a discussion between employer and/or customer
